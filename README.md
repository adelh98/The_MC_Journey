# The_MC_Journey
The start of my minecraft modding career! Follow me along my way of actually learning to make minecraft mods, something I have wanted to do since i started my first modded minecraft world back in 2013!

## My adventure so far:
- I managed to successfully add a simple item, without any functionality, to the game! Baby steps!
- I have managed to successfully add a brand new, custom made, non-functional, block to the game! I'll consider it a Victory!
