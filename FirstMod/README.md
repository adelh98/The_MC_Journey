# Overview
This README will cover the changes i make for the mod throughout its development process.

## Updates:
- Created and configurated the workplace in InteliJ. No issues.
- Added "Ruby" as a material. 
- Added "Ruby Block" as a METAL material. No functionaliy

## Bugs:
- Currently no game breaking bugs. Minor annoyance due to wonky looking texture for the which i made myself in photoshop.
- Item and blocks have no funtionality in the game, making them practically useless. Although not considered a "Bug", it still should be fixed.
