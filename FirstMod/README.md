# Overview
This README will cover the changes i make for the mod throughout its development process. 

Also, "Firstmod" will be my template for future mods. In this mod i will try to learn and implement the basics of modding in Minecraft. Which i will then take with me for my own mods in the future.
Therefore i will also try to comment my code where i think suitable so that when i use it as a template in the future, i don't have to re-learn what i already have went through.

## Updates:
- Created and configurated the workplace in InteliJ. No issues.
- Added "Ruby" as a material. 
- Added "Ruby Block" as a METAL material. No functionaliy
- Added two variants of item grouping in the creative menu.

## Bugs:
- Currently no game breaking bugs. Minor annoyance due to wonky looking texture for the which i made myself in photoshop.
- Item and blocks have no funtionality in the game, making them practically useless. Although not considered a "Bug", it still should be fixed.
